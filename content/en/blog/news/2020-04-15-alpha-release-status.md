**Alpha Status**

I spent much of the past few weeks working on writing [documentation]({{< ref "/docs" >}}) for all of the Scintillator
SuperCollider language classes. I wanted to make sure that most if not all of the available
[VGens]({{< ref "/docs/VGens" >}}) are documented, and also that there was some kind of
[overview]({{< ref "/docs/VGens/VGens-Overview.md" >}}) detailing them.

Things aren't totally finished documentation wise, including some important pieces like the user guide and overall
installation instructions. But I'm going to take a break from working on documentation and turn my attention to the
challenges around distributing binary builds of Scintillator on MacOS
([#72](https://github.com/ScintillatorSynth/Scintillator/issues/72)), and possibly using AppImage on Linux
([#76](https://github.com/ScintillatorSynth/Scintillator/issues/76)).

After that, I'll return to finishing up the user guide and other launch-critical documentation, put the finishing
touches on the Quark, and then announce the availability of the alpha build more broadly.

Thanks to everyone for the words of support and encouragement during this time.
