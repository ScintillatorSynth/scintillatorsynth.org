description: Description of ScinthDef file format used by Scintillator synth server.
---
This is the documentation for the file format used to describe a Video synth, called a ScinthDef, to the Scintillator synth server, scinsynth. The development file format is in YAML, making for easier human readability and debugging. However, despite the difference in format from SuperCollider SynthDef files, the ScinthDef files mostly follow the same structure so should look conceptually familiar. The primary differences are:YAML can provide the length of a list of objects and so we omit sizes of lists as separate fields.Constants are defined inline, instead of at the header block at the top of the file.A ScinthDef file contains one or more YAML documents. Each document roughly follows the SuperCollider SynthDef structure except for that Constants are not identified verbatim but are rather provided directly in the input spec, in keeping with the desire to allow ScinthDef files to be human-readable, as well as the fact that the shader generation code inside of the synth does not require the constants to be separated out.stringname of the ScinthDef, used as primary means of identificationlistAn  key, if the ScinthDef has parameters, will be Parameter YAML dictionaries in an ordered listlistthe VGen YAML dictionaries in an ordered liststringName of the parameter.floatThe default value of the parameter.Individual VGens are specified as YAML dictionaries and have the following keys:stringname of the VGen class, must match the name of a VGen configured on the serverstringcurrently either  or dictionaryOnly required for sampling VGens.
