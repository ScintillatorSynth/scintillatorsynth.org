#### Vulkan Programming

<ul>
<li>

The https://vulkan-tutorial.com##Vulkan Tutorial website. Much of the original Vulkan setup code was typed in following this tutorial. Alexander Overvoorde seems to be the author of this site.

<li>

https://www.saschawillems.de/##Sascha Willems maintains numerous worked examples of various applications of Vulkan on https://github.com/SaschaWillems/Vulkan##GitHub from which I have cribbed from heavily.

<li>

Sascha also maintains the https://vulkan.gpuinfo.org/##Vulkan Hardware Database, a great source of information about the diversity of hardware out there supporting Vulkan.

</ul>
